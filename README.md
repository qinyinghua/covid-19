# Covid-19 Global Forecasting



## Dataset

The most popular data source is from JHU CSSEGI group, the Center for Systems Science and Engineering group in John Hopkin University.  The groups collect various data course and provide daily data update on their project github repository: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19. 

Kaggle has a covid-19 global forecasting contest in a weekly based.  In the Kaggle contest,  the group uses a further combined dataset based on JHU CSSEGI dataset - combine all daily csv files into one complete csv. Here is the Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/imdevskp/corona-virus-report

JHU has a dashboard visualizing the worldwide/country/city number of cases. The map is using arcgis online system while the data is from JHU dataset.  https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6 

We are currently at the middle of the Covid-10 pandemic.  When will this pandemic end? When should the country and state end the shelter-at-home order? At the statistic point of view, we are looking for "flatting the curve". We are looking for the curve of number of cases trending to flat instead of continue increasingly growth.
